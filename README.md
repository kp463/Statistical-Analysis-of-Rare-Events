# Statistical Analysis of Rare Events

## Overview  
This project applies machine learning algorithms and statistical techniques to detect and analyze rare events. It includes handling class imbalance using SMOTE and evaluates models for classification tasks.

## Features  
- Data preprocessing and handling imbalanced datasets.  
- Implementation of SMOTE for oversampling minority classes.  
- Classification models: Logistic Regression, Firth's Logistic Regression, FLAC, Decision Tree, Bagging, Random Forest. 
- Model evaluation with accuracy, precision, recall.

## Installation  

Make sure you have R installed. You can install required packages using:

```r
install.packages(c("library1_name","library2_name",......))
```
